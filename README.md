### Description

Meadow Bloom is an artistic experience in which you have to water wilted flowers as they appear to grow your garden into a flourishing flower meadow. Shoot water droplets at the wilted flowers to transform them into beautiful, vibrant flora. This game is unique in that you cannot die, only grow your meadow to be the biggest and most vibrant that you can.


### Instructions

WASD/Arrow keys to move
Mouse to aim/rotate
Mouse click/Space to shoot

### How it Works

As Meadow Bloom is a pacifist, artistic experience, players cannot die or reach a “game over” screen. The game ends whenever players are finished growing their garden, which depends on each person's patience or preference. The flowers don't spawn on top of each other if there is room to spawn elsewhere on the screen.

### What I’m Most Proud of

I’m proud that I made all the visual assets myself using Aseprite. I’m also proud that I taught myself simple animations and how to import them into Godot.

### What I learned

I learned how to add a main menu, sound effects, and an enemy spawning system into a Godot game. I also learned how to do simple animations and import them into a game. I learned how to make an enemy switch sprites on being hit, and how to randomise the pitch of a sound effect.

### Enemy Behaviours:
There are no true “enemies” in this game, the wilted flowers spawn sporadically around the player wherever they are in the game. They remain static apart from their animation as both wilted and blooming flowers.

### Unique Features:
The most unique thing about Meadow Bloom is the fact that there is no true ending, the game can go forever. The flowers don't despawn after a certain period and they only spawn on screen so eventually the whole screen can be filled with flowe
